PixToy is a simple web app for creating miniature pixelated graphics effects using
the Lua programming language. The app exposes a small set of simple primitive
drawing functions, as well as some other utility functions (maths, bitwise ops, etc.)
to allow the creation of the effects.

Here's an example of a PixToy program and it's output:
